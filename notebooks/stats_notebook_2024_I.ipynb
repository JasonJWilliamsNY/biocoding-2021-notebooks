    "[Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) is (among other things) a way of using mathematical tools to help us answer quantitative questions - or at least describe quantitatively what we are observing. Just like we use python as the syntax for doing programming (making computer algorithms do specific tasks), Statistics is the syntax for doing science. There are several kinds of questions that Statistics often tries to answer:\n",
    "1. How can we understand a characteristic of a particular group?\n",
    "2. What is the best way to describe these \"characteristics\"?\n",
    "3. Can we compare the characteristics between two groups?"

    "### Principle 1 - Population vs Samples\n",
    "First, we need to define a group that we want to study. In Statistics, we often call it a \"population\". All the questions first begin by definiing a population. Let us say we are studying the running speed of Rabbits. Here, our population is \"All Rabbits\". As you may imagine, studying the running speed of every rabbit is next to impossible. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we try to get an estimate of how fast are rabbits? \n",
    "\n",
    "We take a \"sample\" of the population! We go to the woods and observe 5 rabbits running at maximum speed. This would be our sample. We hope that the speeds with which the rabbits in our sample ran are representative of the speeds of rabbits in general (such a good sample is called a \"representative\" sample). You can also take a bad sample. For example, if I observe only 2 rabbits but both had injured legs, their running speeds would be quite low, however, they are not representative of the whole population! (Later we will make quantitative claims about all of these)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: What is the population in the following cases and is the sample representative? How would you change the sample to make it more representative?\n",
    "1. I want to study the blood pressure in humans. I collect the blood pressure of 1000 men in NY.\n",
    "2. I want to study the effect of food on athletes. I study various diets with 1000 swimmers\n",
    "3. (*tricky*) I want to study if the drug has any effect in patients with hypertension. I go to all the hospitals in the US and study all the admitted patients with hypertension.\n"

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "### Principle 2 - Descriptions\n",
    "We have been talking a lot about sampling and comparing it to the population, but we need some quantitative way to make this comparison. Let us stick to a hypothetical dataset of rabbit running speeds:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Running Speed (m/s)|\n",

    "|14|\n",
    "|7|\n",
    "|11|\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we describe this sample? One idea is the idea of an average. An average tries to tell us some measure of the central value in our data. Some rabbits are fast (above the central value), some rabbits are slow (below the central value). But a good descriptor would be the central value, the average rabbit speed. In statistics, we call this the **mean** of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other measures of the central value (called the \"central tendency\"):\n",
    "1. **Mean**: Most popular\n",
    "2. **Median**: If we arrange the data in increasing order, what is the middle value? This is useful in some cases. For example, we want to know how many students study in a high school. We sample 10 high schools. The mean can be something like 100.5 students. but fractional students do not make sense. So we may choose to use a median in this case which will avoid the problem. There are other reasons to use *Median* over *Mean*. **Can you think of any?**\n",
    "3. **Mode**: The value that is repeated the most number of times in a dataset. This is especially useful when the data is categorical. Like what is the favorite color of high-school students. We cannot average across red blue and green or even arange them in increasing order to take their median. We can report the *mode*, which is the color that came up the most frequently!\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, now we have a way of describing different values. We want to try to estimate the population mean by using our sample mean. But if we sample only slow rabbits, our sample mean will be different from (or a bad estimate of) the population mean!\n"
